## Openseadragon-curtain viewer
This viewer is an instance of the openseadragon viewer, which is extended with a plugin to allow different versions of an image to be visualized together. There are 2 viewing modes: curtain and sync. In the curtain mode, the user's cursor creates a split over the canvas, where a different version of the image is shown in each region of the split. In the sync mode, the different images are shown besides one another and these canvases are synchronized so that zooming and panning effects each canvas in the same way. In contrast to the Mirador viewer, this method does not use a IIIF manifest to express the relation between the different versions of the image.

## Mirador viewer

The Mirador viewer allows users to display different versions of images through the use of the IIIF choice keyword within the IIIF manifest itself. A user can choose the opacity of the different images, as shown in the image below.
